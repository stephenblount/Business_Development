## Analysis of the Homelessness Crisis in the United States

The purpose of this project is to create a proposal for a prospective client group. This proposal will aim to help reduce the homelessness crisis through the power of prediction. Trying to predict the population of homeless people within a state for the upcoming year will allow for better planning and resource allocation. A time-series analysis will be proposed to be created from the available data, spanning from 2007 to 2020 for every state in the United States.
